# Mentored Project


<details><b><summary>Why are we doing this?</b></summary>
<p>

>To show off the knowledge I gained from my time at the academy and use my skills learnt in the academy to deploy and test a python application and to store the results in a artefact repository.

</p>
</details>


<details><b><summary>How I expected the challenge to go</b></summary>
<p>
  
>I expected it to be a difficult endeavour given we've only had a month to learn all these skills, however given the amount of resources at my disposal and support from my fellow cohorts and my tutor I believed that it would be manageable effort. During the academy I found that I struggled when trying to push commits to Github as I would forget many of the commands and I would also struggle with using Jenkins during the academy, however I feel more competent in these processes now.

</p>
</details>


<details><b><summary>What went well?</b></summary>
<p>
  
>I found writing scripts, whether it was a yaml or a bin/bash script, to be something that went very well for me. Also I felt my compotency of Jenkins has improved exponentially since when covering the topic during the academy.

</p>
</details>


<details><b><summary>What didn't go as planned?</b></summary>
<p>
  
>Despite growing more confident in my use of Jenkins, that confidence only stems from continuouse trial and error attempts with using Jenkins and trying to alter the configuration of the Jenkins project so it run without faults. To which I grew increasingly frustrated with. However on my last Friday meeting with my QA tutor he advised me to make sure I add a port to send my images to Nexus on the Jenkinsfile.

<details><b><summary>Possible improvements for future challenges</b></summary>
<p>

> One of the things I struggled with during this project and previous challenges was my VM crashing at the most impromptu times. Unfortunately there is no fix for this.

<details><b><summary>Improvements:</b></summary>
<p>

>- Use QA community more
>- Ask for more help
>- Time management
>- Ensure stretch goals are completed

### Tasks
 
Here a Python application that is made up of 4 different services.
 
- Service 1 - Central App
- Service 2 - Provides random numbers
- Service 3 - Provides random letters
- Service 4 - Create an account number (Based on info from service 2&3) and gives a prize based on that account number.
 
You are tasked with deploying this application using all the skills you have developed throughout your time in the academy.
 
Your deployment should make use of,
 
- Docker/Docker-compose
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- Nexus
- SAST Testing
 
You should keep as many metrics as possible and write up reports on them in your README file. These metrics can include.
 
- Testing Coverage
- Deployment Success
- Build Logs
- Security Risks
 
### Stretch Goals
 
1. Use NGINX as a reverse proxy
2. Version Docker images
3. Include DAST Testing and Artefact Scanning
 
### Submission
 
You should create a Git repository that contains the code for the 4 services and any files you created to deploy your application including Dockerfiles, playbooks, reports etc.
You are also expected to make a README.md file and to fill this README with information of this challenge. It should contain the following headers.
 
- Why are we doing this?
- How I expected the challenge to go.
- What went well?
- What didn't go as planned?
- Possible improvements for future challenges.
